# Welcome to Hackboat!

The **Seagoing Vessel Control Environment Laboratory Resource (SVCELR)**, also known as **Hackboat**, is a senior capstone project that aims to create a learning environment for future Coast Guard officers and mariners by demonstrating NMEA 2000 (N2K)’s vulnerability to data injection in a simulated ship voyage environment. This goal will be accomplished through creating an electronics suite that simulates an underway vessel using Common Off-The-Shelf products. Providing this suite in a compact portable structural unit will allow for transportability and presentable appearance for public usage. In addition, examining the exploits in the incorporated electronics and being able to demonstrate those exploits in a real time simulation will provide the necessary proof of concept to audiences as to the potential effects of an attack. 

## Our Mission
Since its introduction in 1997, the National Marine Electronics Association’s NMEA 2000 communications standard has become one of the most used electronic networking protocols in the maritime industry. NMEA has certified over 1000 different devices to utilize the NMEA 2000 (N2K) standard to transmit data between sensors and displays on a common network. N2K networks utilize a bus topology, which, while simple and robust, gives rise to a protocol vulnerability. If exploited, this could impact the operations of the Coast Guard or other theaters of marine transportation without proper awareness and understanding of N2K’s function. Targeted training platforms can help with promoting this awareness. This project aims to create a learning environment for future Coast Guard officers and mariners by demonstrating N2K’s vulnerability to data injection in a simulated ship voyage environment. 

## How to Get Started
- Learn how to read logic using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAXNITXX3iA).
- Read up on the [BCG User Guide](https://github.com/diopausar/Hackboat/blob/057d83b9c1d2bdb4273eb9628e47707de199ea7e/BCG%20Info/BCG%20User%20Guide.pdf) to learn how to run a scenario.

## Development
During the Fall 2020 - Spring 2021 academic year, the inaugural SVCELR capstone project team built the foundation for the project and research that is being continued today. A structural console design was created with the intent to make it resemble the bridge of a vessel, while still maintaining a compact and lightweight structure to support mobility. The console also had a software design with two different functions: reading and writing NMEA 2000 data [12]. With these designs established, the much-needed foundational knowledge and understanding of the NMEA 2000 protocol, shipboard network structure, as well as the mission need for the project, development and construction of the design was eventually able to begin [9]. 

Even with the previous group putting their construction and development of the console into motion, there were many uncontrollable factors that delayed and at times halted progress. The previous group had trouble and a decrease in efficiency due to limited lab access while at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. At times during the semester, the group would have to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The circumstances of the previous semester therefore limited what the group would be fully able to accomplish, but still did not stop the group from reaching achievements and collecting information that would prove to be helpful for future cadets who would be next-in-line to work on this project.

The 2021-2022 team aims to make improvements on the inaugural design both physically and electronically, by redesigning the previous structural unit and investigating more modern solutions for exploiting the electronics. Utilizing modern navigation equipment and realistic scenarios, this enables the possibility of diversifying learning opportunities for users and keeping this project relevant over time. Inspired by the team at [FATHOM5](https://www.fathom5.co/), this controlled environment laboratory resource is designed to display the effects of a cyber-attack while underway on a vessel, and the simulations produced by the entire system make this mission possible.
