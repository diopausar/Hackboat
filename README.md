# Hackboat

The Seagoing Vessel Control Environment Laboratory Resource (SVCELR), also known as Hackboat, is a senior capstone project that aims to create a learning environment for future Coast Guard officers and mariners by demonstrating NMEA 2000 (N2K)’s vulnerability to data injection in a simulated ship voyage environment. This goal will be accomplished through creating an electronics suite that simulates an underway vessel using Common Off-The-Shelf products. Providing this suite in a compact portable structural unit will allow for transportability and presentable appearance for public usage. In addition, examining the exploits in the incorporated electronics and being able to demonstrate those exploits in a real time simulation will provide the necessary proof of concept to audiences as to the potential effects of an attack. 

## The Mission
Since its introduction in 1997, the National Marine Electronics Association’s NMEA 2000 communications standard has become one of the most used electronic networking protocols in the maritime industry. NMEA has certified over 1000 different devices to utilize the NMEA 2000 (N2K) standard to transmit data between sensors and displays on a common network. N2K networks utilize a bus topology, which, while simple and robust, gives rise to a protocol vulnerability. If exploited, this could impact the operations of the Coast Guard or other theaters of marine transportation without proper awareness and understanding of N2K’s function. Targeted training platforms can help with promoting this awareness. This project aims to create a learning environment for future Coast Guard officers and mariners by demonstrating N2K’s vulnerability to data injection in a simulated ship voyage environment.
