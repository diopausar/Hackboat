# Hackboat

The Seagoing Vessel Control Environment Laboratory Resource (SVCELR), also known as Hackboat, is a senior capstone project that aims to create a learning environment for future Coast Guard officers and mariners by demonstrating N2Kâ€™s vulnerability to data injection in a simulated ship voyage environment.

The SVCELR aims to be a learning tool with the ability to educate professional mariners on the impact a cyber-attack on a seagoing vessel. Creating an electronics suite that simulates an underway vessel using Common Off-The-Shelf products will provide applicability to the target audience, which may be Coast Guard Academy Cadets, training center classes, or marine electronics developers. Providing this suite in a compact portable structural unit will allow for transportability and presentable appearance for public usage. In addition, examining the exploits in the incorporated electronics and being able to demonstrate those exploits in a real time simulation will provide the necessary proof of concept to audiences as to the potential effects of an attack.
