# CAN Protocol

Electronics connected to the NMEA-2000 network communicate in digital sentences sent over only two wires in what is known as a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. CAN is an International Standardization Organization (ISO) defined serial communications bus that was originally developed for the automotive industry to replace complex wiring with a two-wire bus [3]. Today, this protocol is used in most cars and trucks. Several messages can be transmitted in a CAN network like temperature and speed. This allows NMEA-2000 networks to be robust in a variety of conditions, characteristic of a marine environment [4].
