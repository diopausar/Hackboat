# NMEA 2000
Since its introduction in 1997, the National Marine Electronics Association’s NMEA 2000 communications standard has become one of the most used electronic networking protocols in the maritime industry. NMEA has certified over 1000 different devices to utilize the NMEA 2000 (N2K) standard to transmit data between sensors and displays on a common network [1]. N2K networks operate on a bus topology, which, while simple and robust, gives rise to a protocol vulnerability. If exploited, this could impact the operations of the Coast Guard or other theaters of marine transportation without proper awareness and understanding of N2K’s function [Appendix A].

The National Marine Electronics Association NMEA-2000 communication standard encompasses a wide variety of navigational equipment which can be networked on a single backbone or bus to communicate with each other and be compartmentalized on a display.
