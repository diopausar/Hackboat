# Welcome to Hackboat
Welcome to the Seagoing Vessel Control Environment Laboratory Resource (SVCELR), also known commonly as Hackboat. Hackboat is a mobile educational training resource designed by cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy to demonstrate the possibility and effect of false data injection into an NMEAA 2000 (N2K) network. 
## The Design
The console is a sinle portable unit designed with the capacity for enough electronics to demonstrate the projectâ€™s premise. The console utilizes N2K marine devices in conjunction with a microcontroller and open-source code to produce a repeatable attack scenario, where real sensor data is over-written by spoofed data produced from an adversarial device physically connected to the network. The demonstration unit is available for public display and usage, including a comprehensive online lesson plan.
## Spreading Awareness
SVCELR aims to help spread awareness to a variety of audiences, which will hopefully prompt further research into encryption or data authentication methods for N2K devices.
## Sponsors
The SVCELR is sponsored by the Coast Guard Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, and Intelligence Service Center (C5ISC) as well as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), all serving as the major project stakeholders.
